## Data

qPCR data was obtained from:

HLA-A: WebPlotDigitizer on Fig 1 in [Ramsuram et al, HMG, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddv158)

HLA-B: WebPlotDigitizer on Fig 5C in [Ramsuram et al, JI, 2017](http://www.jimmunol.org/content/198/6/2320)

HLA-C: Shared by Pat, originally in Fig S1 in [Kulkarni et al, PNAS, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1312237110)

## Statistical comparison between pairs of lineages

In the table below,

`a1` and `a2`: a pair of lineages;

`p_qpcr` and `p_hlapers`: p-value\* from a Mann-Whitney test for each lineage pair in qPCR and RNA-seq data, respectively;

`signif_qpcr` and `signif_hlapers`: whether p values are significant (1) or not (0) at FDR = 5%;

`sign_qpcr` and `sign_hlapers`: (1) if expression of `a1` > expression of `a2`, or (-1) if expression of `a1` < expression of `a2`.

\*p-values were calculated only for lineages with >=10 points, and were ajusted for multiple testing (FDR method).

The table shows all pairs present in the qPCR data, and their results in RNA-seq for comparison. When a pair present in qPCR data is not present in RNA-seq data, we have NA.


```{r}
read_tsv("./results.tsv") %>% kable(digits = 2)
```


### Significant pairs in both qPCR and RNA-seq


```{r}
read_tsv("./results_significant.tsv") %>% kable(digits = 2)
```
